## My Work
<p>
From Consulting to Creating My Own Software

After several years working as a Senior ERP Consultant, helping companies optimize their processes and improve their management, I identified a key market need: a flexible, efficient, and accessible online administration solution.

With this vision, I developed Allianz, an online management software designed to simplify business administration. Built with robust technologies such as PHP, SQL, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, Allianz combines functionality and performance to offer companies an intuitive and powerful platform.

Today, Allianz is a tool that enables businesses to manage their operations efficiently, leveraging years of experience in ERP implementation across various industries. This project represents my commitment to innovation and digital transformation, providing a solution that adapts to the ever-changing needs of the business world.

Creating Web Solutions
  
Throughout my professional career, I have developed multiple websites for different industries, adapting to the specific needs of each sector. From ecommerce platforms with integrated payment systems to informational websites optimized for SEO and interactive platforms that enhance user experience.

Each project has presented a unique challenge, allowing me to apply various technologies and approaches to create functional, intuitive, and visually appealing solutions. My focus has always been on designing websites that not only meet business requirements but also drive growth and enhance digital presence.

Today, I continue to innovate and refine my skills to develop efficient, modern websites tailored to the ever-changing market needs.

My Journey as a Data Scientist
  
Throughout my experience as a Data Scientist, I have developed multiple projects focused on extracting value from data. From data analysis and cleaning to advanced segmentation, I have worked on transforming information into actionable insights.

Using various Machine Learning techniques, I have implemented predictive models to optimize processes and support data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I have designed and developed interactive dashboards, enabling clear and effective data visualization and presentation.

To reinforce and certify my knowledge, I completed the TripleTen Bootcamp, where I strengthened my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and insight communication. This experience has allowed me to refine my approaches and apply best practices in every project.

My passion for data continues to drive me to innovate and find solutions based on artificial intelligence and advanced analytics.
